# Upgrading

:::caution Before upgrading
Before upgrading, make sure you have backed up your configuration, trusted certificates and data to be able to restore the platform in case of any issues.

Never downgrade the platform version, as it may cause data loss or other issues. Be sure that you are upgrading to higher version of the Helm chart.
:::

:::info Upgrade vs Install
Platform can be installed from scratch anytime when you have a backup of your database and configuration. New installation through the Helm chart will deploy new environment connecting to the same database. You can install multiple instances of the platform in different clusters and infrastructures with the same database.
:::

The following contains important information and instructions about upgrading Helm charts.

Upgrading Helm chart is done by running the `helm upgrade` command. The command upgrades the platform to the specified version. The command can be used to upgrade the platform to the same version with changed parameters.

## To 2.6.0

### ACME endpoint and trusted IPs

The API gateway sub-chart was updated to support ACME endpoint and trusted IPs.
Trusted IP addresses defines blocks that are known to send correct `X-Forwarded-*` headers which is important to generate correct URLs for the clients communicating with the platform behind gateway and proxy.

Trusted IP addresses can be configured in the API gateway dependency for the umbrella:
```yaml
apiGateway:
  trustedIps: ""
```

### Additional connector sub-charts

The Software Cryptography Provider connector was added as sub-chart to the umbrella chart.

When you enable new connector during upgrade, you need to register the connector manually in the platform:
```yaml
softwareCryptographyProvider:
  enabled: false
```

See the [CZERTAINLY Helm chart 2.6.0 release note](https://github.com/3KeyCompany/CZERTAINLY-Helm-Charts/releases/tag/2.6.0) for more information.

## To 2.5.2

### Container image configuration

Configuration of container registry has changed. The new configuration is more flexible and allows to use multiple container registries, including configuration of registry globally.

Every image that is supported in the umbrella chart or sub-charts now has the following structure:
```yaml
image:
  # default registry name
  registry: docker.io
  # default repository name
  repository: 3keycompany/czertainly-core
  # default image tag
  tag: "2.5.2"
  # the digest to be used instead of the tag, will override tag if specified
  digest: ""
  # default image pull policy
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  # array of image pull secrets
  pullSecrets: []
```

Container registry and image pull secrets can be also configured globally for the umbrella chart and all of its sub-charts using global parameters, for example:
```yaml
global:
  image:
    # registry name
    registry: "harbor.czertainly.online"
    # array of secret names
    pullSecrets:
      - harbor-registry-credentials
      - dockerhub-registry-credentials
```

### Additional connector sub-charts

The following sub-charts were added to support additional connectors as optional components:
- Cryptosense Discovery Provider
- Network Discovery Provider
- Keystore Entity Provider

When you enable new connector during upgrade, you need to register the connector manually in the platform:
```yaml
cryptosenseDiscoveryProvider:
  enabled: false

networkDiscoveryProvider:
  enabled: false

keystoreEntityProvider:
  enabled: false
```
